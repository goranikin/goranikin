## About Me

I've been reading and writing. All the things I've written are my vestiges of my life.
I believe that they'll be profound nourishment for the future.

You can read my writing at [my blog](https://hyeok12053.dev/). I recommend reading [it](https://hyeok12053.dev/writing/personal-essay/itinerary), though I apologize to English readers — it's written in Korean.

## Technical Focus

I'm interested in the AI/ML field, especially computer vision and image generation. However, this is relatively more interesting than other fields and I haven't chosen what I'm going to dig into.

## Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, I enjoy:
- Reading and writing
- Running marathons (completed full course)
- Indoor climbing (also rock climbing)

I have many interests in the world Such as specialty coffee, contemporary art, classical music concert, plants and so on.
